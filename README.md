# diff_backend_edu

A comparative analysis of backend implementations for a Task Management System using various technologies.

## Project Overview

### **Task Management System: Backend Comparison**

This project aims to compare different backend technologies by implementing the same Task Management System (TMS)
functionality. The system will include user registration, login, and basic task operations (create, read, update,
delete). The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed with TypeScript and ReactJS, while the backend is
implemented in multiple frameworks and languages. This will allow for an evaluation of each technology's ease of use,
performance, and overall strengths and weaknesses.

### **Backend Implementations**

The backend is developed using the following technologies:

1. **Java + Spring Boot**
2. **Node.js + Express.js**
3. **Python + Django**
4. **GoLang + Gin**

Each implementation will support:

- User registration and login with JWT-based authentication
- Basic CRUD operations for task management

This project is educational in nature, designed to highlight the pros and cons of each backend framework.
